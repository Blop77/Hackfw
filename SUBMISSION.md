```
RideTaste: AI Bike Rides Planned Around Your Taste
```

## Elevator pitch (≤ 200)

```
Tell the agent the films, music and food you love. It plans a bike ride with café and food stops picked by Qloo's taste AI, and explains why each stop fits you.

## About the project (Markdown)

```markdown
## Inspiration
I ride my bike a lot around Pune, and the hardest part of a weekend ride isn't the route, it's deciding *where to stop*. Map apps show me the nearest café, not the one I'd actually like. I wanted a riding buddy who knows my taste: if I love lo-fi music, Studio Ghibli films and South Indian food, the ride should go past places that fit that vibe.

## What it does
RideTaste is an AI agent that plans bike rides around your taste.
1. You chat with it: say where you're starting, roughly how far you want to ride, and a few films, artists, foods or books you love.
2. The agent turns your favourites into Qloo entities and asks **Qloo's Taste AI** for places near you that people with your taste enjoy.
3. It picks 1–6 stops that fit your distance, routes the ride for a bike, and shows it on a map with a short reason for each stop.
4. You can change it: "shorter", "more food, less sightseeing", "end near a lake".
5. **Ride with a friend:** add what your friend loves, and RideTaste asks Qloo for each of you separately, then picks stops you'd *both* enjoy, showing each rider's match on every stop.
6. You can download the ride as **GPX** for Strava, Komoot or a bike computer.

## How I built it
- **Qloo Insights API:** `/search` resolves each favourite to a Qloo entity, and `/v2/insights` with `filter.type=urn:entity:place`, `signal.interests.entities` and `filter.location` returns nearby places with an affinity score. Qloo is the core of the app: without it there's no link from "I love Spirited Away" to "this café".
- **Agent:** Claude (Anthropic API) with two tools. `plan_ride` runs the pipeline and `show_ride` writes a grounded one-line reason for each stop. The system prompt tells it to use only tool data, never invent opening hours or prices, and say when data is sample or approximate. If Claude is ever unavailable, the app falls back to the same planner without the chat, so Qloo still picks every stop.
- **Choosing stops:** a greedy planner inserts each stop at its cheapest point in the ride and scores candidates by taste and distance fit:

$$\text{score} = \text{affinity} \times \text{preference} \times 0.75^{\text{repeats}} - \lambda \cdot \Delta\lvert L - T \rvert$$

where *L* is the current ride length, *T* the requested distance and \\( \lambda = 0.6/T \\). While the ride is too short a detour helps; once it's long enough a detour costs. The 0.75 repeat factor mixes cafés, food and sights.
- **Maps:** OpenStreetMap geocoding (Nominatim), bike routing (OSRM bike profile) and Leaflet.
- **Stack:** Node.js with no framework, plain HTML/CSS/JS and 57 automated tests (`node --test`).

## Challenges I ran into
- **Rides came out far too short.** My first scoring rule just penalised detours, so a 15 km request gave a 5 km ride, because the best-matching places were all close together. Scoring by how much a stop moves the ride *towards the requested distance* fixed it.
- **Honest explanations.** Qloo's affinity says how much people with your taste like a place, not *which* favourite caused it. I had to stop the agent from claiming "because you like X".
- **Working without keys.** I built a clearly labelled demo mode and offline fallbacks for geocoding and routing, so the app and its tests run anywhere.
- **Food isn't an entity.** "Filter coffee" or "momos" aren't films or artists, so they don't fit Qloo's entity search. In Qloo they're *tags*, so food tastes now go through `/v2/tags` and are sent as `signal.interests.tags`.
- **Rate limits in friend mode.** Riding with a friend doubles the Qloo calls, and my first version hit HTTP 429. I added a small client that keeps at most two Qloo requests in flight, retries 429/503 with backoff (honouring `Retry-After`) and caches lookups privately on the server.
- **Real data, odd stops.** Live results included places that aren't good ride stops: a whole district ("Pune city"), a hotel and a cosmetics shop. I wrote a categoriser that reads Qloo's tags and the place name with whole-word matching, and skips areas, hotels and errands by default.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- It runs on live Qloo data in Pune, where I ride, and in New York, with real bike routes and "at km X" for every stop.
- **Ride with a friend** really blends two tastes: a stop only ranks high if Qloo says it suits both of you, and each stop shows both matches (e.g. German Bakery: you 79%, friend 81%).
- Every recommendation is explainable: the "How Qloo picked these stops" panel shows the Qloo matches, how many places came back and how the stops were chosen.
- 57 automated tests run in GitHub Actions on Node 20 and 22, and there's a demo mode so anyone can run it without keys.

## What I learned
- **How Qloo's taste graph links domains.** A film and a singer can point to a café. The affinity score says how much people with your taste like a place, but not *which* favourite caused it, so the explanations have to stay honest.
- **Designing tools for an agent.** Two small tools with structured output, plus a system prompt that keeps every claim grounded in tool data, worked better than letting the model plan on its own.
- **Being a good API citizen.** One click in my app fans out into several API calls, so throttling, retries and caching matter early.
- **Shipping for real users.** CI, hosting on Render, keeping the server awake and writing for judges who use the app directly.

## What's next for RideTaste
- Group rides with more than two riders
- Opening hours, elevation and traffic-aware routing
- Save and share favourite rides

## How to test (add to the end of "About the project")

```markdown
## Try it in 30 seconds
1. Open the live demo: https://ridetaste.onrender.com. If the first load is slow, the free server is waking up; give it up to a minute.
2. Click one of the **"Try one"** examples (e.g. *Ghibli & filter coffee · Pune*, or *Ride with a friend · Pune*). The agent plans a ride with Qloo.
3. Open **"How Qloo picked these stops"** under the map to see the Qloo entities, the places Qloo returned, and how the stops were chosen.
4. In the chat, tap **More food** or type *"make it shorter and end near a lake"* to watch the agent re-plan.
5. Click **Download GPX** to take the ride into Strava, Komoot or a bike computer.
